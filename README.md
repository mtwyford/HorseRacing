# HorseRacing
Project for students to design a horse racing game with a data collection of horse objects, stats for each horse, etc

* There will be 15 horses in total.
* 5 random horses are chosen for the race.
* The student will bet on first, second, and third place winners, (Show, Place, Win)
* For each horse, there will be at least 5 variables that affect the racing quality of the houses.
* * These variables include age, height, weight, weather, and the distance of the race.
* These variables will be presented to students when they are making a choice to inform them of the odds

* Students will develop a formula to have the game generate the odds of each horse winning.

After that, horses will start to run. Update the running status each time hourses run until all of the horses have reached the end.

See if your bet is the final result.
