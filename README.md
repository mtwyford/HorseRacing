# HorseRacing
Project for students to design a horse racing game with a data collection of horse objects, stats for each horse, etc

* There will be 15 horses in total.
* 5 random horses and chosen for the race.
* The student have to bet on first place, second place, and third place.
* For each house, there will be variables that affect the racing quality of the houses.
* These variables include age, height, weight, weather, and the distance of the race.
* These variables will be presented to students when they are making a choice.

After that, horses will start to run. Update the running status each time hourses run until all of the horses have reached the end.

See if your bet is the final result.
